Change the ``ImageCleaner`` API from __call__(self, tel_id, image, peak_time)
to __call__(self, tel_id: int, event: ArrayEventContainer) so cleaning
algorithms can now access relevant information for methods 
that e.g. require monitoring information.

The __call__ function now internally uses an abstract 
clean_image(self, tel_id, image, peak_time) method
defined by each ImageCleaner subclass.
