Change R1- and DL0-waveforms datamodel shape from (n_pixels, n_samples)
to be always (n_channels, n_pixels, n_samples). This breaks reading in single
gain data of older versions (< v6.0.0) with the ``HDF5EventSource``.

Re-introduce also the possibility of running ``ImageExtractor``\s on data
consisting of multiple gain channels.
