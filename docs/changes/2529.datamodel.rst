Change R1- and DL0-waveforms datamodel shape from (n_pixels, n_samples)
to be always (n_channels, n_pixels, n_samples). ``HDF5EventSource`` was adjusted
accordingly to support also older datamodel versions.

Re-introduce also the possibility of running ``ImageExtractor``\s on data
consisting of multiple gain channels.
