Implement Components and Tools to perform training and application of 
machine learning models based on scikit-learn.

Three new tools are implemented:
- ``ctapipe-train-energy-regressor``
- ``ctapipe-train-particle-classifier``
- ``ctapipe-apply-models``

The first two tools are used to train energy regression and particle classification
respectively and the third tool can apply those models in bulk to input files.
``ctapipe-process`` can now also apply models trained with the first two tools directly in
the event loop.

The intended workflow is to process training files to a combined dl1 / dl2 level
using ``ctapipe-process``, merging those to large training files using ``ctapipe-merge``
and then train the models.
