Implement a ``SoftwareTrigger`` component to handle the effect of
selecting sub-arrays from larger arrays in the simulations.
The component can remove events where the stereo trigger would not have
decided to record an event and also remove single telescopes from events
for cases like the CTA LSTs, that have their own hardware stereo trigger
that requires at least two LSTs taking part in an event.
