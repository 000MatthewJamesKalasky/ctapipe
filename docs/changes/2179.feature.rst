Add a new ``ctapipe.io.HDF5Merger`` component that can selectively merge
HDF5 files produced with ctapipe. The new component is now used in the
``ctapipe-merge`` tool but can also be used on its own.
Through using this new component, ``ctapipe-merge`` gained support for
fine-grained control which information should be included in the output file
and for appending to existing output files.
