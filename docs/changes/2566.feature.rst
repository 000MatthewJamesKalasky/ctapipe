Add ``SystemExit`` handling at the ``ctapipe.core.Tool`` level

If a ``SystemExit`` with a custom error code is generated during the tool execution,
the tool will be terminated gracefully and the error code will be preserved and propagated.

The ``Activity`` statuses have been updated to ``["running", "success", "interrupted", "error"]``.
The ``"running"`` status is assigned at init.
