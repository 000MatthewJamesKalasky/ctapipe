``Tool`` now comes with an ``ExitStack`` that enables proper
handling of context-manager members inside ``Tool.run``.
Things that require a cleanup step should be implemented
as context managers and be added to the tool like this:

.. code::

    self.foo = self.enter_context(Foo())

This will ensure that ``Foo.__exit__`` is called when the
``Tool`` terminates, for whatever reason.
