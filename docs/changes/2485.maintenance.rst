The ``from_name`` methods of instrument description classes now raise a warning
that it is better to access instrument information via a ``SubarrayDescription``.

Also improve documentation in instrument module to explain when not to use the
various ``from_name()`` methods. These are provided for the case when no event
data is available, e.g. for unit testing or demos, but do not guarantee that the
returned instrument information corresponds to a particular set of event data.
