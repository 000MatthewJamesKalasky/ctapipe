Brainstorm
==========

This directory contains a bunch of demo scripts that I had used to
explore some concepts for the framework. They do not use the ctapipe
module directly.

proposal_demos

    runnable code that is in the PDF proposal summary document

misc_demos

    random pieces of code (mostly working, but may need some support
    files to be copied from the ctapipe_data directory)

notebooks

    random thoughts and tests in IPython notebook format (run `ipython
    notebook` to access)
